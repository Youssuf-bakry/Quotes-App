# Quotes-App

![ScreenShot](/public/SCREENSHOT.png)

### My first React App providing a nice quotes web application.

---
<span style="color:blue"> *Please add a nice quote if you wish* text
 [here](https://yosefquotes.netlify.app/all-quotes)
</span>.


## Challenges :

1. using custom hooks in react in this app was a great experience on how to make it more flexible and reusable.
2. Tweeking the css to be an arabic app ( at least in the quote section only) is an added value to my skills.

### Technologies & Tools used

1. HTML5
2. Css
3. React / Router v5
4. Firebase
5. Visual Studio

### Opportunities to enhance

1. Responsive design on the mobile is not 100% (as it wasn't the scope of this project)
2. Converting to Router v6 .
